            <p>Our team has dedicated the last 6 months at the University of Washington’s School of Informatics building this
                fully-functioning internal tool for the startup Arrived Homes.</p>
            <p>After Spring 2021, our client will have full proprietary access to the frontend web application, the backend
                database, and the logic that decides housing criteria and investment opportunity information.</p>
            <p>Our team will be keeping this project open to the next cohort of iSchool students to continue adding features and
                improvements to the overall workflow. We are incredibly pleased with the experience offered by the Arrived Homes
                team, and we
                hope to share this with other members of the iSchool for years to come.</p>
